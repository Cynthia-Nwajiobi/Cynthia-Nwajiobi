👋 Hi, I’m Cynthia Nwajiobi

I'm a healthcare data analyst, specialised in helping health and wellness teams make sense of their patient and operational data. 

Think dashboards, insights, and decision-ready clarity without the headache. I’ve worked with telehealth startups, NGOs, and public health teams to solve real-world problems like adherence, outcomes, and service delivery gaps.
